BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of  hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and the recombinant  formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are  needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with  standard-dose vaccines against influenza-related outcomes in adults under the age  of 65 years"

Flublok Quadrivalent Flublok Quadrivalent has been administered to and safety data collected from 4328 adults 50 years of age and older (Study 6 1) and 998 adults 18-49 years of age (Study 7 2). SAEs were collected for 6 months post-vaccination via clinic visit or remote contact. Study 6 (NCT02285998) enrolled subjects 50 years of age and older, randomized to receive Flublok Quadrivalent or Comparator (Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) as an active control [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . The safety analysis population included 4328 Flublok Quadrivalent recipients and 4344 Comparator vaccine recipients. The mean age of participants was 62.7 years"

The proportion of FluBlok recipients with a post-vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5%), 97% for the H3 component (94.8%, 98.3%), and 96% for the B component (94.0%, 97.8%). Among FluBlok recipients, subjects with a self-reported history of seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine in the year prior to the study had higher baseline titers of antibody against all three components, and had signiﬁcantly lower frequencies of HAI response than did those who reported that they had not received vaccine in the previous year. Subjects who reported prior vaccine receipt also had lower post vaccination GMTs for all three components than did those without this history, and this difference was statistically signiﬁcant for both inﬂuenza A components. 3.3"
